Tuned amplifiers are critical for electronic communications because
they increase the power of desired signal but reject other frequencies
as noise. At 10 MHz, a tuned amplifier could be used with an antenna
to recieve HF amateur radio from the other side of the world,
\footnote{10 MHz waves can traverse the curve of the earth because
they get reflected by charged particles in the ionosphere, called
ionospheric skip propagation.}
or could be used in a computer to recieve 10Base-T ethernet.
